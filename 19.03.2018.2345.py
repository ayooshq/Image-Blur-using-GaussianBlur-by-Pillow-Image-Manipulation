#This is the command line to be implemented
#Scripts and 'imagefilter. Image' will be imported from the PIL
from PIL import Image

#Note: In this case the image and the 19.03.2018.2345.py are present in the same directory. Therefore I need not to copy the full path for the cause. 
#The image format can vary within JPG/JPEG, PNG and GIF. SVG is under process, for that you can import svglib.svglib
pic = "thenameoftheimage.jp

   


#Run the Module. A new file with the specified name will be generated. Adios!
